# payroll

## This is a sample Java program that is meant to aid in payroll computation

The program is supposed to accept user input on employee number, employee name, designation, days worked, pay rate, and generation date. The program should then compute **basic pay** which is **days worked * Pay rate**. The **P.F** is calculated by **basicpay/10**. The **PROF TAX** is computed by taking **20% of BASICPAY**. The program should then display the output exactly as show in the screenshot.
